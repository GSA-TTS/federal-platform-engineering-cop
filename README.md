# [The Federal Platform Engineering Community](../../wiki) (FPEC) 

The **Federal Platform Engineering Community (FPEC)** brings
together technologists that are building and operating platforms
that are better enabling software and systems, ultimately to help
make developers more productive, their applications more rapidly
able to be delivered, and positively impacting end users.  We will
facilitate spreading lessons learned in building modern platforms
to support a variety of needs across the federal government, as
well as spreading the courage to change in adopting modern technology
management and procurement practices.  This community
will continue conversations and partnership begun with the [18F
DevOps Community of
Practice](https://github.com/18F/DevOps-Community-of-Practice/wiki/DevOps-Community-of-Practice).

This README is largely a placeholder. All the real activity
is over in the [Wiki](../../wiki) and in [Discussions](../../discussions).
